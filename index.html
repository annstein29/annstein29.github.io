        Native Interactive Web Designer. I graduated from Drexel University in 2012 with a degree in Graphic Design
        with a concentration in Web Design. For the past 6 years I have worked at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
        As of last April I am also an Adjunct Professor of Web Design at Drexel, teaching in the department I graduated
        from myself!

      <p>For 10 years I competed as a Springboard Diver and was a member of the USA Diving Club. I have also studied
        fine arts for 12 years. My favorite artists come from the Renaissance. I am also an avid traveler and in 2018
        from January through September I have traveled to Miami, Fl, San Francisco, CA, Israel and Andalusia, Spain. It
        has been an amazing year for travel and there is much more to come!</p>
